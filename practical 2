Aim   :Initial settings: Add a User, Network Settings, Change to static IP address, Disable IPv6 if not needed, Configure Services,
       display the list of services which are running, Stop and turn OFF auto-start setting for a service if you donâ€™t 
       need it, Sudo Settings.
       
Steps:
Step1 : Addng a user: 
                  A user can be added one or more added in a group too.
  command to add a user syntax is : $sudo adduser <username>

2.) Network settings: The ip address and the ethernet connections and other network connections can be viewed using the :
    comand: $sudo ip a   (or)  $sudo ip addr

3.) Configuring services: services are also known as daemons which efficiently run in the background, services usually have a 'd' in last 
                          of their name to identify it as a daemon for example - smbd , nmbd,etc
    services can be lookout in the /etc/ folder as mostly the services lie there for example: $sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf 

4.) List of services running: command to list the currently active and running services:- $sudo systemctl

5.) Command enable a service:                 $sudo systemctl enable <service_name>
    Command start a service:                  $sudo systemctl start <service_name>
    Command check the status of a service:    $sudo systemctl status <service_name>
    Command stop a service:                   $sudo systemctl stop <service_name>
    Command auto-start a service:             $sudo systemctl restart <service_name>
