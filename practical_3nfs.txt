                                     Practical No: 3
*Aim   :Configure NFS server to share directories or files on your network.
*Theory:Network File System (NFS) is a client/server application that lets a computer user view and optionally store and 
        update files on a remote computer as though they were on the user's own computer.The NFS protocol is one of several 
        distributed file system standards for network-attached storage(NAS).
 
*Steps:

step1: install NFS server:
       pankali@kali:~$ sudo apt-get -y install kernel-server
       pankali@kali:~$ sudo apt-get -y install nfs-kernel-server

step2:Command to enable a service:  
      pankali@kali:~$ sudo systemctl enable nfs-kernel-server

step3:create directory,vi mode,show file ,moving to dir,show file
      pankali@kali:~$ mkdir hello_dir
      pankali@kali:~$ vi pankaj.txt
      pankali@kali:~$ ls pankaj.txt
      pankali@kali:~$ mv pankaj.txt hello_dir
      pankali@kali:~$ ls /home/pankali/hello_dir

step4:Now we have to mention our /directory_path ip_address (permissions), we need to give rw (read,write) permission,
   the commands for this is as follows:

   pankali@kali:~$ sudo vi /etc/exports
   pankali@kali:~$cat /etc/exports
   -After /directory_path ip_address (permissions)
      /home/pankali/hello_dir 127.0.0.1(rw)


step5:Now  exports:
   pankali@kali:~$ sudo exportfs -ra

step6:To allow file sharing between systems on your network
      pankali@kali:~$ sudo apt-get -y install nfs-common
      
step7:Now to mount the file:
      pankali@kali:~$ sudo mount -t nfs 127.0.01:/home/pankali/hello_dir /home/hello_directory
      
step8:the mounted file in the directory that user has made:
       pankali@kali:~$ cd /home/hello_directory
       
step9:ls
