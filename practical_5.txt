                             Practical No: 5

*Aim: Install Samba to share folders or files between Windows and Linux.


*theory:
   Samba is an open-source software suite that runs on Unix/Linux based platforms but is able to communicate with 
   Windows clients like a native application. So Samba is able to provide this service by employing the Common 
   Internet File System (CIFS).

   At the heart of this CIFS is the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. 
   Samba does this by performing these 4 key things â€“
   File & print services
   Authentication and Authorization
   Name resolution
   Service announcement (browsing)

   Samba can be run on many different platforms including Linux, Unix, OpenVMS and operating systems other
   than Windows and allows the user to interact with a Windows client or server natively. It can basically be described as 
   the Standard Windows interoperability suite of programs for Linux and Unix

*Steps:

step1:-Install Samba Server:
       pankali@kali:~$ sudo apt-get -y install samba

step2:-Start samba service:
       Pankali@kali:~$ sudo systemctl start smbd

step3:-check the status samba service:
       pankali@kali:~$ sudo systemctl status smbd

step4:-start nmbd service:
       pankali@kali:~$ sudo systemctl start nmbd

step5:-start nmbd service:
       pankali@kali:~$ sudo systemctl status nmbd

step6:-samba_shared directory in /home/pankali        ----(#creating a new directory )
       pankali@kali:~$ mkdir samba_shared  
      
step7:-create one or two txt  files in /home/pankali/samba_shared 
       pankali@kali:~$ cd samba_shared
       pankali@kali:~/samba_shared$ touch a.txt b.txt c.txt

step8:-go to samba folder 
       pankali@kali:~$ cd /etc/samba
       pankali@kali:~$ ls /etc/samba

step9:-backup smb.conf 
       pankali@kali:~$ cp smb.conf smb.conf_bkp 

step10:-now configuration in /etc/smb.conf
        pankali@kali:~$ sudo nano smb.conf

step11:-Then delete all the smb.conf and then write:
    [samba_shared]
	comment = welcpome pankaj  in samba
	path = /home/pankali/samba_shared
	browseable = yes
	read only = yes
	guest ok = no

 *ctrl x and then y and save the file.* 

step12:-Now, smbclient if not there then the command is:
        pankali@kali:~$ sudo apt-get -y install smbclient
 
step13:-start/stop services of smbd and nmbd
        pankali@kali:~$ sudo systemctl start smbd
        pankali@kali:~$ sudo systemctl stop nmbd

step14:-now check 
        pankali@kali:~$ whoami

step15:- 
        pankali@kali:~$ sudo pdbedit -a -u $(whoami)

step16:-Type and retype your password:
        pankali@kali:~$ sudo pdbedit -L (to check all users)

step17:-This will make any connectionn possible to connect:
        $ sudo ufw allow from (your ip addr) any app Samba

        In my case it was:
        pankali@kali:~$ sudo ufw allow from 192.168.56.0/24 to any app Samba

step18:-To check for your ip then use this command : 
        pankali@kali:~$ ip a 

step19:- Now to reload your firewall use:
         pankali@kali:~$ sudo ufw reload  

step20:-To check whether it's working or not, use:
        $ sudo smbclient -U <username> -L  //your ip

        In my case it was:
        pankali@kali:~$ sudo smbcllient -U pankali -L  //192.168.56.101

step21:- Now restart both smbd and nmbd services:
         pankali@kali:~$ sudo systemctl restart smbd
         pankali@kali:~$ sudo systemctl restart nmbd

step22:- Do also check their status 
        pankali@kali:~$ sudo systemctl status smbd
        pankali@kali:~$ sudo systemctl status nmbd

*Windows OS Part:
- Once smbd and nmbd services are active now switch back to your windows OS and press windows + R key on keyboard and 
   now a pop up box will open and their write smbclient ip address, 
   here in my case it was //192.168.56.101 and press OK.

-Now again one more pop up box will open, write the credentials of your Windows or Kali or whatever it would be.

- Now in top of the address bar you can see Network > 192.168.56.101 (your ip address)
   in this you can see samba_shared and documents folder.

- In samba_shared server you can see all the txt files that we've made earlier, using touch command.

-Once all your samba_shared files are visible in windows, then the sharing of files/folders have been 
   successfully done between Windows and Kali Linux.
