*Aim:- Configure NTP, Install and Configure NTP Server, Configure NTP Client.

*Description:-

->The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched, 
  variable-latency data networks.
->NTP is one of the oldest Internet protocols in current use. 

->NTP is intended to synchronize all participating computers to within a few milliseconds of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
->It uses the intersection algorithm, a modified version of Marzullo's algorithm, to select accurate time servers and is designed 
  to mitigate the effects of variable network latency. 

->The protocol is usually described in terms of a client-server model, but can as easily be used in peer-to-peer relationships where both peers consider 
  the other to be a potential time source.Implementations send and receive timestamps using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) on port number 123.
->They can also use broadcasting or multicasting, where clients passively listen to time updates after an initial round-trip calibrating exchange.
->NTP supplies a warning of any impending leap second adjustment, but no information about local time zones or daylight saving time is transmitted.

->SNTP (Simple Network Time Protocol) is basically also NTP,
  As a full implementation of the NTP protocol seemed too complicated for many systems, a simplified version of the protocol, namely SNTP had been defined.
->The current protocol is version 4 (NTPv4).


*steps and commands:-

step1:-update packages:
       pankali@kali:~$ sudo apt update -y

step2:-check kali version:
       pankali@kali:~$ uname -a

step3:-install NTP:
       pankali@kali:~$ sudo apt install ntp

step4:-Then install SNTP:
       pankali@kali:~$ sudo apt install sntp

step5:-now we check  the sntp version:
       pankali@kali:~$ sudo sntp --version
       **Enter in etc floder
       pankali@kali:~$ cd /etc
       **ls all the files
       pankali@kali:~$ ls -lrth *ntp.conf*

step6:-To start & status the service: 
       pankali@kali:~$ sudo systemctl start ntp
       pankali@kali:~$ sudo systemctl status ntp

step7:-To configure NTP:
       pankali@kali:~$ sudo nano /etc/ntp.conf
       ---------------------------------------------------------------------
       # You need to talk to an NTP server or two (or three).
       server localhost    ---(type)
       ---------------------------------------------------------------------

step8:-To check the conf file:
       pankali@kali:~$ cat ntp.conf

step9:-now restart & check the status of ntp service: 
        pankali@kali:~$ sudo systemctl restart ntp
        pankali@kali:~$ sudo systemctl status ntp
step10:-To check connection:                     
         panakli@kali:~$ sudo ntpq -p
