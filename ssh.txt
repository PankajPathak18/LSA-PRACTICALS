port:
SSH client connection - Port: 22
Telnet  client connection - Port number: 23

*Steps*:
step1. Command for install ssh server:
       pankali@kali:~$ sudo apt-get -y install openssh-server
step2. Command for enable a service:  
       pankali@kali:~$ sudo systemctl enable ssh

step3. Command to check the status of a service:  
       pankali@kali:~$ sudo systemctl status ssh

step4.To install ufw command -:
      pankali@kali:~$ sudo apt-get -y install ufw

step5.configure user's server to allow incoming SSH connections, user can use this command: 
      pankali@kali:~$ sudo ufw allow ssh

step6.now user can connect to  ssh localhost:
      1-pankali@kali:~$ ssh localhost
      2-pankali@kali:~$ ssh 127.0.0.1

enter the root password to autoconnect the localhost.
